# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 Performance-Driven Full-Stack Developer & Electronics Engineer

I’m a **performance-obsessed Full-Stack Developer** and **Electronics Engineer** focused on building **fast, predictable, and scalable systems**.
I optimize aggressively — from **SQL execution plans** to **React render cycles** — and I prefer tools that stay out of my way.

I run **all services on Bun and Go**, organize everything inside a **Turbo monorepo**, and treat performance as a **first-class requirement**, not an afterthought.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

* ⚡ **Speed > Convenience**
* 🧩 **Monorepo-first architecture**
* 🔁 **Zero unnecessary abstractions**
* 🎯 **Every render, query, and syscall matters**
* 🧠 **If I can reason about it, I can optimize it**

I actively avoid over-engineered stacks and ORMs.
I prefer **raw SQL**, **explicit data flow**, and **measurable performance gains**.

## 🛠️ Core Stack & Tooling

### Backend

* **Runtime**: Bun (primary), Go
* **APIs**: HTTP, REST, GraphQL, real-time systems
* **Databases**: PostgreSQL (raw SQL only — no ORM)
* **Data Access**: Bun native SQL
* **Architecture**: Turbo monorepo for all services & apps

### Frontend

* **React (performance-focused)**
* **TanStack Ecosystem (heavy user)**

  * TanStack Start
  * TanStack Router
  * TanStack Query
  * TanStack Store / DB
* **State Strategy**: Server-state first, minimal client state
* **Rendering Discipline**: I actively optimize to avoid **even a single unnecessary render**

### Performance & Real-Time

* WebSockets & streaming architectures
* Short-lived HTTP-based real-time architectures
* Pub/Sub patterns
* Low-latency data paths
* Query-level and render-level profiling

---

## 🧩 What I Care About (A Lot)

* **Render cost in React**
* **Cold-start times**
* **Query execution plans**
* **Network round-trips**
* **Bundle size & hydration**
* **Predictable performance under load**

If something adds abstraction without measurable value, I don’t use it.

## 🧪 Currently Building
A performance-first SaaS platform with Bun, raw SQL, and render-level React profiling.

## 📈 GitHub Activity

![Activity Graph](https://github-readme-activity-graph.vercel.app/graph?username=acoBOYZ&theme=github-compact)

Consistency over spikes — I prefer steady iteration and continuous refinement.

## ⚙️ Electronics Engineering Background

Alongside software, I’m a trained **Electronics Engineer** with hands-on experience in **low-level systems** and **hardware-software integration**.

### Highlights

* **Low-Level Programming**: C/C++, embedded systems, bare-metal thinking
* **PCB Design**: Schematic design, prototyping, validation
* **Industry Experience**:

  * Military-grade systems
  * Industrial automation
  * Consumer electronics
* **Mindset**: Determinism, reliability, and system boundaries

This background strongly influences how I design software systems.

## 💬 Personal Traits

* **Performance-driven problem solver**
* **Opinionated, but pragmatic**
* **Tooling minimalist**
* **Open-source friendly**
* **Always profiling, always refining**

*This repository reflects how I think, build, and optimize systems — from hardware-level constraints to frontend render paths. I value speed, clarity, and control at every layer.*
